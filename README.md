# Scripts to generate tables, figures and maps for the global TB report
*(Shared by Tom and Hazim, so either can run regardless of which office they are sitting in.)*

## Use

1. Make sure you have your version of `get_tables_figures_environment.r` set up to load TB data and to establish where outpute files will be saved.

2. Then, in R, do:

```
> source(create_tables_figures.r)
```
